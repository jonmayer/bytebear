bytebear is a typo of bytebeat.  It is meant to be a quick, dirty, easy
tool for people to create microcompositions in C++ that can be readily
linked into an execution environment that provides useful audio and
visual output formats.

All modules must implement a constructor, destructor, and Run method
for the ByteBear class defined in bytebear.h.  Everything else is automagic.
